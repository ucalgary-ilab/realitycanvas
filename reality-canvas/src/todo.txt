2. object augmentation  (done)


3. hardcoded particle rain 
    What is the difference between object augmentation and emit?
    Obj Augmentation:
        select -> draw graph-> save(bind)
    Emit:
        select -> draw particle -> emit line:
            Here, the emit line is binding to the object, instead of the particle.
            The particle can spawn on the emit line; anyway, it is just like the 
            object augmentation, select => bind.

    How to implement?
        By creating the Emitter Class.
        The Emitter class handle the creation, update and destruction of the particles.
